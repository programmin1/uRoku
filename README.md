uRoku
--------------------------

Quick Roku remote application, Electron. Code still needs to be leaned up a bit and some features and tests added.
It is partially running and dependent on some Ubuntu-UI things right now.
There is some good documentation of the commands here: 
https://developer.roku.com/docs/developer-program/debugging/external-control-api.md#keypress-key-values

To get up and running, bower install the dependencies, download the Ubuntu SDK and import the Project.

    cd www
    bower install
    cd ..
    npm i
    npm start
